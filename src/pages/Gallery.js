      <p id="OriginArtworks">
        Origin Virtual is an interactive web exhibition by Sydney Media Arts
        collective <a href="https://www.originart.xyz/">Origin</a>.
        <br />
        <br />
        This exhibition was born out of the current environment which forced
        artists to quickly adapt to a new normal in which the Virtual plane
        becomes increasingly necessary to everyday life. Origin (Virtual)
        features artworks that push the boundaries of websites as a medium, with
        artists interrogating the applications of artificial intelligence,
        generative art and audiovisual installations in the virtual space.
        <br />
        <br />
        In doing so, Origin seeks to deconstruct the traditional online gallery
        experience whilst addressing how social interaction and spectacle has
        morphed during our time inside.
