          Re: Reality is an ongoing interactive installation work that is
          designed with Affordance at its center.
          <br />
          <br />
          Built to contribute to a discussion around the validity of immersion
          and level of presence within mixed reality spaces, Re: Reality invites
          its users feel present within the hybrid physical/virtual space, and
          without needing to hide the systems working parts. Intrigued by how
          the setting of spaces alone can activate strong emotional responses, I
          aspired to develop Re: Reality into an explorable space that allows
          the audience to take a passive or active position within its
          boundaries and still feel immersed. This multi-sensory mixed reality
          work utilises positional sound, natural fragrances, passive
          interaction with the virtual, active involvement with the physical and
          an upscaled visual feed in order to offer a telepresent experience.
          <br />
          <br />
          The motivating theory behind Re: Reality is particularly driven by
          (but not exclusive to) Whitelaw's observation of data as an agent to
          activate connecting realities which he defines as Transmateriality,
          and Barfield’s coined term for the highest level of immersion within
          mixed reality environments, known as Telepresence. Using the root and
          application of these theoretical terms to build off of, Re: Reality
          has been designed with the audience’s level of immersion at the
          forefront of the experience. Inspiration for this work is a
          combination of mixed reality installation such as Gibson & Martelli’s
          Vermillion Lake and Refik Anadol’s Melting Memories, as well as video
          games like Campo Santo’s Firewatch and Jonathan Blow’s The Witness;
          all of which share a common theme of invitation, immersion, philosophy
          and presence. It is within this material that the audience is
          encouraged to feel enveloped by the space with scale, layered
          narrative and interactive elements to ensure the capacity for
          exploration.

          Re: Reality is both an extension and a combination of two previous
          works I have developed throughout the course of my Research; Cinder
          (2017) and Re: Reality (Fowlers Gap) (2018). Though they share
          conceptual DNA, their approaches to recontextualising the physical
          with the digital differ and compliment each other. Cinder is designed
          to have physical elements reinforce the virtual space in order to
          create an inviting space. Re: Reality (Fowlers Gap) is built with the
          intent of reappropriating the physical into the virtual in order to
          personify a site, while still being ultimately screen based. With both
          systems having unique interactions that equally dictate my desired
          result, it felt only necessary to combine them.
          <br />
          <br />
          The visual subject of Re: Reality depicts a natural scape; a valley
          between cliffs gilded with pine trees on a moonlit night, where the
          audience is presented with a campfire. Physical properties such as
          grass, firewood, pine trees and camp chairs are positioned in line
          with the projection of this scene. When entering the space, the
          audience is joined by the giant of Fowlers Gap, who constructs itself
          in the distance. Using motion tracking, the giant is able to follow
          the positions of the participants and looks between them. Aligning
          with Miwon Kwon’s analysis of Site-Specific Art, Re: Reality supports
          the claim that a site is not bound to physicality or even a space to
          be entered, but instead be anything that can platform a response.
          <br />
          <br />
          Re: Reality aims to solidify and support the concept that there are no
          hierarchies in different realities when it comes to experience and
          emotion, only different levels of involvement.
